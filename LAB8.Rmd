# Task 1

```{r}
getwd()
```

# Task 2

## Create a sample of size n=10 from a uniform distribution that has lower limit 0 and upper limit 5 by using runif(10,0,5). 
```{r}
runif(10,0,5)
```

## Give the mean and variance of the uniform for the case where a=0, b=5

```{r}
mean = (0+5)/2
'mean'
mean
variance = ((5-0)^2)/12
'variance'
variance
```

## 	Use the sample you made to calculate x^bar and s^2. How do they compare to the population parameters?

```{r}
